# Resources AI Chatbot Plugin

## Introduction

Beginners often struggle to take their first steps with Jenkins’ documentation and available resources. To address this challenge, this plugin integrates an AI-powered assistant directly into the Jenkins interface. It offers quick, intuitive support to users of all experience levels through a simple conversational UI.

The plugin is designed to reduce the learning curve for newcomers while also improving accessibility and productivity for experienced users.

This plugin was developed as part of a Google Summer of Code 2025 project.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.11+
- **Build tools**: `make`, `cmake` (≥3.14), C/C++ compiler (`gcc`/`clang`/MSVC)
- **Java**: JDK 11+ and Maven 3.6+ (for plugin development)

### Example system package installation

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian/WSL
sudo apt install -y make cmake gcc g++ python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev

# macOS
brew install cmake python@3.11 && xcode-select --install
```



## Getting Started

### Setup

Complete the full setup process in [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) before running any commands. This includes creating a virtual environment, installing Python dependencies (including llama-cpp-python), and configuring the data pipeline.

### Running the API

Once setup is complete:

```bash
make api
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

Verify it's working:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chatbot/sessions
```



See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for detailed explanations.

## Troubleshooting

**llama-cpp-python installation fails**: Ensure build tools are installed and use Python 3.11+

**API crashes on startup**:
This may be caused by missing optional dependencies (e.g. `retriv`).

Try installing missing packages:
```bash
pip install llama-cpp-python retriv 
```

**General issues**: Run `make clean && make <target>`, verify your virtual environment is activated, and ensure all dependencies from [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) are installed.
